# NFT Demo
hello
This project creates a smart contract and then deploys it to Rinkeby public testnet and Polygon mainnet.  
NFT's can then be minted by sending transaction to the deployed smart contract.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repo and run npm install.  
   `git clone https://github.com/neha01/nft-demo.git && cd nft-demo && npm install`

2. Put image file that you want to convert into an NFT under assets folder.

   Update `filePath` with your image filepath.  
   Run `node scripts/runScript` command.  
   This will call Pinata API's and will upload file to IPFS and a new file will be created in `data` folder `ipfsHash.json` and the
   Pinata response containing the `ipfsHash` will be populated in that file.

5. Now create a metadata.json file with the details about your NFT. For Reference checkout data/metadata.json file .
   Update `filePath` with your metadata filepath.
   Again Run `node scripts/runScript` command.
   This will call Pinata API's and will upload metadata file to IPFS and the Pinata response containing the `ipfsHash` will be again populated in `ipfsHash.json` file.

6. Install latest solidity version by running `npm install solc` and Dont forget to update this solidity version in truffle-config.

7. Update Rinkeby test network details in `truffle-config.js` .  
   Update your account mnemonic in `.env` file.  
   Now run `truffle console --network rinkeby` to connect to Rinkeby Public test network.  
   Run `migrate` command to deploy the contract on Rinkeby testnet.  
   Run `let art = await ArtCollectible.deployed()`.  
   Run `await art.claimItem('https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmREBUVuoeX39eB9KiQjp25RFr2dhYF6zawpYXq1UPJXEz')`  
   Pass the correct metadata file IPFS address to claimItem.  
   Run `art.address` to get contract address.

9. To deploy your NFT on polygon mainnet  
   Update MNEMONIC of your MATIC funded Metamask account in .env file.   
   Run `npx truffle migrate --network matic`
   This will deploy your contract to polygon mainnet.    
   Copy the deployed contract address and update it in .env file.  
   Pass your metadata file tokenURI in cliamItem in mintNft.js.
